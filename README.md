Applied Statistical Projects with R
This repository contains a series of R Quarto notebooks with a focus on hands-on statistical modeling using the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) dataset and other real-world data sources.

Each project demonstrates applied analysis using R — including exploratory analysis, distribution modeling, regression, diagnostics, and final reporting.

Author: Chantal Ojurongbe
Language: R
Format: Quarto (.qmd)

📁 Contents
File	Title	Description
1	Initial analysis using JHS data: descriptive stats, exploration
2	Expanded analysis of JHS data including modeling approaches
3	Continued analysis with added complexity and data visualization
4	Advanced feature engineering and transformation using fastDummies
5	Distribution fitting using external datasets (e.g. video game data)
6	Comprehensive modeling with JHS data; reproducibility practices applied
7	Take Home Final	Culminating applied analysis for SDS II with final interpretations

🚀 Getting Started
To explore the notebooks:
Clone the repository or download the .qmd files.
Open them using RStudio with the Quarto extension.

🧠 Key Concepts Demonstrated
Data cleaning and transformation
Statistical distribution fitting
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Linear and multiple regression
Residual diagnostics
Model justification and interpretation
Reproducible workflows (set.seed(), clear outputs)

📌 Notes
Most projects use the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) dataset. The dataset is available for full reproducibility.
External data (like video game dataset) are available for full reproducibility.
All files are written in .qmd format and require Quarto for rendering.
