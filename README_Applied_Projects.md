# Applied Statistical Projects with R: Jackson Heart Study

This repository contains a series of R Quarto notebooks developed for **SDS II (Statistical Data Science II)**, with a focus on hands-on statistical modeling using the **Jackson Heart Study (JHS)** dataset and other real-world data sources.

Each project demonstrates applied analysis using R ‚Äî including exploratory analysis, distribution modeling, regression, diagnostics, and final reporting.

Author: **Chantal Ojurongbe**  
Language: **R**  
Format: Quarto (.qmd) to HTML

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore the notebooks:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.qmd` files.
2. Open them using **RStudio** with the **Quarto** extension.
3. Render each notebook to HTML using the **Render** button in RStudio.

## üß† Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and transformation
- Statistical distribution fitting
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Linear and multiple regression
- Residual diagnostics
- Model justification and interpretation
- Reproducible workflows (`set.seed()`, clear outputs)

---

## üìå Notes

- Most projects use the **Jackson Heart Study (JHS)** dataset. Ensure that the dataset is available locally for full reproducibility.
- External data (like video game dataset) may be fetched via provided URLs.
- All files are written in `.qmd` format and require Quarto for rendering.
